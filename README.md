## Questions

### Learning Group Structure

	- How do you organize your meetings: 
	- Do you have a format? Is it free flowing or structured?

#### How often do you meet? Where?
	- Free flow - we have no strict structure learning structure. Other than we meet weekly, on a Saturday between 3/4hrs 		each sesssion.
	- In the event one of us have an coding, or learning issue - even something from their everyday coding job she/he can 		raise that at any time. We offer as a group, our perspectives, support and help in solving the issue.
	- but when we are learning together for a course (react / gutenberg) we developed a routine / schedule base on the
#### Course Structure
	- Example: Advanced Gutenberg 
	- 2 Chapters Video for one week
	- Practical coding on the second 
	- alternating

#### What tools do we use to connect our group and allow/support collaberation?
	- Slack Channel
	- Google Hangout
	- GitHub Individual Accounts & Organisation
	- VS Code - Live Share. PHPStorm
	- Twitter, medium, Coding sites, podcasts and individuals

#### Do we have guests? It depends.
	- When topics rise
	- Or we find out about interesting topics - we ask people around us to help/explain the topic, to share their 		  knowledge, expertise and experiences. i.e. Like React hooks, PHP, WPScripts, ESLint, working with the new 
	  WP block editor
	- WP Code standards, difficult to understand documentation, git, version control, markup etc.

#### Does your group have rules?
	- No 
	- We meet weekly or as often as need given certin circomstances. For instance the JS-Hackathon
	- Wehen we decide to take our courses collectively
	- Keep each other motivated and intrested in learning the new material. We help each other through group discussion 	      confussing or difficut areas or topics to grasp. For example: State in React
	- We all work with and around the WP Community. So we come pre wired towards "acceptable behavior." We belive in,               and practice both individully and collectivlly the 'WP Code-of-Conduct.'
	- Value & support each other. We value each others time, participation, family and the group relationships. 
	- Safe space - where you can be vulnerable, be supported, experience, and learn. (You don't need to knowing                     everything)

### Goals and Benefits of learning groups

#### Do you have goals as a group?
	- Yes! Both - individual and group goals:
		- enable each of us to talk about our personal goals/and results so far. Persoanl assesment.
#### The Big picture group goals: 
	- creating a safe space to learn with confidence and support 
	- small learning group creates an intimacy (that peer to peer suport with out the one-up-manship 
          or comdepitive presure) 
	- facilates learning 2 ways. 1) two person teams and as a group review. We learn along side each 
	  other, grow and share.
	- The intmacy and trust helps each individule practice more, share more and grow more, especially 
	  where there maybe knowledge and or experience gaps.

#### How has being part of the group helped you grow?
	- It has helped us to stay motivated and learning
	- Reduce procrastination
	- Provides accountability, especailly to the group
	- Continuity in learning - we meet every Saturday. 3/4 hrs. The winter months longer (because its easier).
	- Achieve more together than we would on our own
		- by learning together
		- by sharring
		- by teaching each others
		- by supporting each other
		- by challenging each other without making members feel uncomfortable or stupid
		- by adding all our different perspectives to problem solving

	- Do you think collaboration is a more successful way of tackling self-learning online? Yes! Please explain.

#### How has being part of this group affected your life? 
	- How has being part of this group affected coding and proffesional skills 
	- Personal thoughts/opinions (2/3 sentences) - personal anwser from each participant

#### What do you choose to give to the group as individuals?
	- The Value of People and the relationships we build
    	- Apart from learning to code we're available to support each other
    	- Keep each other informed share links, posts articles videos in Slack

### Closing Remarks

#### What would be your top three takeways/tips to share with our audience -- when considering or committing to a study group?
	- Get your support group on board (work, family, friends)
		- Without their support it will not be possible
	- Find a timeframe everybody can be part of it
	- Value yourself, your time and your commitment. And all these same things of your fellow participants.
	  **Don't take people for granted.**
	- Leverage quality software, development tools, and services that a) makes it easy for everyone to participate, 	  connect and collaberate - weekly.
	  b) Helps you learn, and get comfortable working with proffesional level workflows 
	- Rotate the mediator position
	- allow for spontaneity, and organic conversations
	- HAVE FUN! DON'T TAKE YOURSELF TO SERIOUSLY. Life is short and code is poetry! Stay thirsty ðŸ˜€
